# FrameworkWithFAN1
FBAudienceNetwork is a static framework, meaning that it is a .framework package with a static library executable (as opposed to a dynamic library executable). Use this repo and FrameworkWithFAN2 to test the effects of having two frameworks, which both depend on FAN, separately added to a single application.
